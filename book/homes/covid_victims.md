This is a dataset of individual victims of the covid pandemic in Hungary. It updates daily and uses several [sources](#sources)

## How This is Created

1. A researcher finds https://koronavirus.gov.hu/elhunytak and figures they could do some useful research with this individual level data, maybe even better if joined with temporal information, vaccine data and test results
2. They write an email with the link and the idea for such a dataset to sscub@krtk.hu
3. In the response we either:
  - give an estimated time of completion for such a dataset and start downloading and linking the data, conduct some initial analysis of maybe some of our own ideas for hypotheses
  - propose some changes / extensions, 
  - set up connections with other researchers who requested similar datasets
  - point to work already in progress that creates this or a similar dataset


In this case we could download and link the data in about one day.
